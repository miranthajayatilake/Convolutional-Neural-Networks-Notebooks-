# Convolutional Neural Networks Notebooks from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization 

This is a collection of rough sketch notes I've maintained from following Andrew Ng's 4th course, Convolutional Neural Networks, in Deep Learning Specialization Serires.

These notebooks won't provide very elaborated explainations of the contents on the course. These are only revise notes after following the lectures. Just sharing in case any one wants to recall concepts discussed in the course.

You're welcome to use these notebooks and improve these as you want to, in order to have these as revising material to help obtain a strong grasp of the basic concepts of ML.
